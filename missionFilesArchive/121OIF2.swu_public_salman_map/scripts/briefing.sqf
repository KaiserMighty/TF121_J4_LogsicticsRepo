Fox Company is spread out around Al-Salman. 1st Platoon has taken up positions at the old fort, 2nd Platoon is holding short of the southern checkpoint, and 3rd Platoon has set up a checkpoint even further back at the T-intersection. The task remains the same, proceed down route Prince while clearing it of obstacles and enemy to secure the route for follow-on forces. The crossroads at objective Troll have yet to be reconnoitered, but the Iraqi forces must be exonerated from their control of the key terrain. This must be accomplished before nightfall for the Task Force to remain on schedule with adjacent units and tasking.

With their command and control center destroyed, it's unlikely that the enemy have any coherent plan for delaying US forces anymore. Pockets of Iraqi forces are likely to uphold their previous orders and take local initiative to maneuver as needed. 2nd platoon encountered a BRDM-2 at the southern checkpoint, so it's safe to assume they have another one at the northern checkpoint. We're still not sure what the enemy presence looks like at OBJ Troll if they are there at all. Battalion estimates that while it is possible that local civilians might join Iraqi forces in resisting US advances, they think it's currently unlikely due to the distance of Al-Salman from hardcore Saddam influence.

Earlier in the day, the platoon engaged a prepared enemy positions on the hills north of the assembly area and occupied the old fort that was being used as a command and control center. 2nd Platoon attempted moving up route Prince but they were halted by Iraqi forces at the southern checkpoint, with a BRDM-2 posing the greatest threat. 2nd Platoon, already understrength, did not press the attack, and rallied at a building short of the checkpoint. 3rd Platoon has set up at the T-intersection to halt other forces from proceeding down route Prince until cleared. Currently, a supply convoy is halted there. They are behind schedule and need to proceed down route Prince to rejoin with their parent unit.

Fox Company, 2/8 Marines is part of Task Force TARAWA. 2/8 Marines is a light infantry battalion and outfitted with HMMWV vehicles as opposed to the AAVs and LAV-25s that normal Marine infantry units have. As such, Fox Coy has been placed at the left edge of the Task Force and tasked with screening and route clearance. The main effort is heading towards the city of Baghdad, Fox Coy is to keep key routes and objectives open and clear to allow follow-on units or supporting units freedom of maneuver if the main force gets bogged down or overwise delayed. Should the main effort meet any sizable resistance along their route, flanking elements can maneuver around the enemy using the routes cleared and secured by Fox Coy. Due to the peripheral nature of Fox Coy's tasking, the company and parent battalion does not have priority of fires, supports, or resupply.
