The Iraqis are expected to have a sizable presence West of the river. However, the enemy does not have any night vision capability, use this to your advantage. Since you are separated from your vehicles, you have limited ammunition on your person. Avoid getting in extended firefights with the enemy; keep engagements short but intense. Since the enemy cannot see you without illumination, maneuver around their forces and patrols to find the best possible positions and timings before engaging the Iraqis.

The battle in Nasiriyah rages on into the night, and the Marines sustain their requests for air support, their pleas getting more and more desperate as times goes on. As night falls, many aircraft pass through the gap without getting struck due to the enemy's lack of night vision capability, but the anti-aircraft platoon still poses a threat. Perhaps not a significant one at night, but once the sun rises and they regain good sight, they will once again turn away aircraft. As soon as humanly possible, this air corridor must be opened and rendered safe from anti-aircraft fire.

Fox Company, 2/8 Marines is part of Task Force TARAWA. 2/8 Marines is a light infantry battalion and outfitted with HMMWV vehicles as opposed to the AAVs and LAV-25s that normal Marine infantry units have. As such, Fox Coy has been placed at the left edge of the Task Force and tasked with screening and route clearance. The main effort is heading towards the city of Baghdad, Fox Coy is to keep key routes and objectives open and clear to allow follow-on units or supporting units freedom of maneuver if the main force gets bogged down or overwise delayed. Should the main effort meet any sizable resistance along their route, flanking elements can maneuver around the enemy using the routes cleared and secured by Fox Coy. Due to the peripheral nature of Fox Coy's tasking, the company and parent battalion does not have priority of fires, supports, or resupply.
