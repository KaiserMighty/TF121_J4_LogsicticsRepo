1st platoon must proceed along Route Prince until it meets up with the main highway the rest of the US forces have been using. Ensure it is clear of obstacles including explosives. Once on the main highway, follow it north to Nisul, and secure the H-52 airbase. The airbase itself should not be heavily guarded, but the route up to there might have considerable resistance. Engage and destroy all Iraqi forces encountered to ensure they do not pose a threat to follow on forces. If you bypass contact and/or ambushes, return back to the site to engage them on more favorable terms.

S-2 says that other units in the region have been fighting mainly Republican Guard within the main city region, but they believe that the outskirts are primarily tasked for Saddam's loyalist Fedayeen forces. The idea being that the Fedayeen would recruit or force locals to fight alongside them to bolster their numbers, and conduct a guerilla campaign to delay or stop US forces. Fedayeen forces themselves are fairly lightly equipped, but the locals with them are a wild card. They might have all sorts of weaponry and vehicles, as such, we're expecting technicals, obstacles, and whatever else they might throw at us to slow us down.

The US advance has reached Baghdad, the main effort of the Task Force and larger US force has been committed into the city proper. Guard and Screen units, like Fox Company, have been tasked with securing peripheral regions around Baghdad. Baghdad International Airport was captured earlier after encountered the heaviest resistance yet. US Army forces have made decent progress within the city so far, with a column of tanks speeding through dense city streets and executing what they're calling a "thunder run." As the Iraqi resistance continues to crumble, the risk of a chemical attack has become nearly non-existent. US Forces have been ordered out of their MOPP suits as a result.

Fox Company, 2/8 Marines is part of Task Force TARAWA. 2/8 Marines is a light infantry battalion and outfitted with HMMWV vehicles as opposed to the AAVs and LAV-25s that normal Marine infantry units have. As such, Fox Coy has been placed at the left edge of the Task Force and tasked with screening and route clearance. The main effort is heading towards the city of Baghdad, Fox Coy is to keep key routes and objectives open and clear to allow follow-on units or supporting units freedom of maneuver if the main force gets bogged down or overwise delayed. Should the main effort meet any sizable resistance along their route, flanking elements can maneuver around the enemy using the routes cleared and secured by Fox Coy. Due to the peripheral nature of Fox Coy's tasking, the company and parent battalion does not have priority of fires, supports, or resupply.
