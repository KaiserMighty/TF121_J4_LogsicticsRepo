Fox Company has set up a Company CP along a rural portion of route Prince. Our task is to infiltrate across the river, locate the anti-aircraft platoon, and destroy it to reopen the air corridor for the Task Force. Supply vehicles had some difficulty moving through route Prince at Al-Salman due to lingering enemy resistance; as such, we are unable to get a full resupply. The Company has allotted what remaining extra supplies it has to 1st platoon. 2nd platoon is tasked with local security around the CP, and 3rd platoon is held in reserve to fill in if and where needed.

Battalion S-2 believes that the 47th Infantry Division is holding up in the region. They're believed to be reinforced by about a platoon of ZSU-23s (between 2 to 4), which are using a key road to continuously reposition and avoid counter-battery fire. They keep their radars off, and are also unable to be targeted by SEAD/DEAD sorties. The main 47th force is located across the river to the west, and likely have early warning and other defenses at likely crossing points. Similar to the 85th that were found at Al-Salman, the 47th are also not high on Saddam's priority of arming and supply, they are also likely using commandeered civilian vehicles, some armed, to substitute and bolster equipment shortages.

A US Army supply mistaken turned into the city of Nasiriyah and got ambushed by Iraqi forces. Eleven American soldiers were killed and several were taken prisoner. Task Force Tarawa is on the scene attempting to secure two bridges to allow US forces a clear path through, but the situation is still developing. Marines engaged in the fighting are requiring all the fires they can get, including the Task Force howitzers and all the air support that can be mustered. However, Vipers and Apaches moving along the nearby air corridor are not all able to make it to Nasiriyah. Many are getting turned around by Anti-Aircraft positions, suspected to be ZSU-23s. Marines at Nasiriyah need the air corridor clear to speed up the actions on objective with air support.

Fox Company, 2/8 Marines is part of Task Force TARAWA. 2/8 Marines is a light infantry battalion and outfitted with HMMWV vehicles as opposed to the AAVs and LAV-25s that normal Marine infantry units have. As such, Fox Coy has been placed at the left edge of the Task Force and tasked with screening and route clearance. The main effort is heading towards the city of Baghdad, Fox Coy is to keep key routes and objectives open and clear to allow follow-on units or supporting units freedom of maneuver if the main force gets bogged down or overwise delayed. Should the main effort meet any sizable resistance along their route, flanking elements can maneuver around the enemy using the routes cleared and secured by Fox Coy. Due to the peripheral nature of Fox Coy's tasking, the company and parent battalion does not have priority of fires, supports, or resupply.
