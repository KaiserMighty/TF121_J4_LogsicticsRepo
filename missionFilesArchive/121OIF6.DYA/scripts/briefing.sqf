Fox Company is located at OBJ Dragon. All except 1st platoon is tasked with perimeter security, while 1st platoon has been ordered on the offensive. We know at least one enemy position, the northern bridge. Proceed to the northern bridge, seek out the enemy, and destroy them. Keep in mind that the enemy composition is likely similar to the southern bridge, it's likely they have armored and mechanized vehicles in the vicinity of not just the bridge, but the general surroundings as a whole.

S-2 believes that some portion of the enemy mechanized vehicles still remain in the area. It's likely that the enemy is at least located around the northern bridge that was not cleared during the assault on OBJ Dragon, in addition to other locations. S-2 is still working on coming up with likely enemy dispositions and course of actions, but we've been told to get a head start in the meantime. Company HQ will pass down an updated intel report when they have it available.

OBJ Dragon has been secured, but the enemy presence did not meet intelligence estimates. As such, battalion believes that the enemy might still be around the AO. This enemy force may pose a threat to the follow-on forces that will occupy the airfield. As such, while we wait for adjacent friendly forces to arrive, Fox Company has been tasked to search for, and destroy, any remaining Republican Guard formations in the vicinity.

Fox Company, 2/8 Marines is part of Task Force TARAWA. 2/8 Marines is a light infantry battalion and outfitted with HMMWV vehicles as opposed to the AAVs and LAV-25s that normal Marine infantry units have. As such, Fox Coy has been placed at the left edge of the Task Force and tasked with screening and route clearance. The main effort is heading towards the city of Baghdad, Fox Coy is to keep key routes and objectives open and clear to allow follow-on units or supporting units freedom of maneuver if the main force gets bogged down or overwise delayed. Should the main effort meet any sizable resistance along their route, flanking elements can maneuver around the enemy using the routes cleared and secured by Fox Coy. Due to the peripheral nature of Fox Coy's tasking, the company and parent battalion does not have priority of fires, supports, or resupply.
